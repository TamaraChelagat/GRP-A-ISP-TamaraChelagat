# FraudDetectPro â€“ Explainable Machine Learning for Transactional Anomaly Detection  

FraudDetectPro is a hybrid machine learning system for **real-time credit card fraud detection**, developed as part of a final year Informatics and Computer Science project at Strathmore University. The system integrates **ensemble learning**, **anomaly detection**, and **explainable AI (XAI)** to enhance accuracy, transparency, and trust in fraud detection.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Traditional fraud detection systems struggle with:
- **Extreme class imbalance** (fraud <0.5% of transactions).
- **High false positives**, leading to poor customer experience.
- **Black-box ML models**, which lack interpretability for analysts and regulators.

FraudDetectPro addresses these challenges by combining:
- **Supervised ensemble models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).  
- **Unsupervised anomaly detection** (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders).  
- **Explainability modules** using **SHAP** and **LIME** for model transparency.  

The result is a **robust, scalable, and explainable fraud detection framework** for financial institutions.

## ðŸ§© System Architecture
1. **Data Source Layer** â€“ Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset & simulated real-time streams.  
2. **Data Processing Layer** â€“ Cleaning, normalization, SMOTE/ADASYN balancing, and feature engineering (temporal + behavioral).  
3. **Machine Learning Layer** â€“ Ensemble classifiers + anomaly detectors.  
4. **Explainability Layer** â€“ SHAP and LIME provide feature-level reasoning.  
5. **Application Layer (API)** â€“ REST API for predictions and retraining.  
6. **User Interface Layer** â€“ Web dashboard for fraud analysts and system admins.  
7. **Feedback Loop** â€“ Analyst feedback informs model retraining.

## ðŸ“Š CRISP-DM Methodology
FraudDetectPro development follows the **CRISP-DM** process:
- **Business Understanding** â€“ Improve fraud detection accuracy and interpretability.  
- **Data Preparation** â€“ Preprocessing, feature selection, balancing.  
- **Modeling** â€“ Ensemble + hybrid ML models.  
- **Evaluation** â€“ Precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.  
- **Deployment** â€“ Interactive dashboard with explainability tools.
